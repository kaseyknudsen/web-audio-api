web audio is based on modular routing

we use code to connect the nodes

we need to use audio buffer so javscript can understand.

An audio buffer represents a certain duration of sound. It stores the amplitude value of the signal

when working with audio on a computer, we use discreet signals, which splits a 
continuous signal into a sequence of samples

an audio buffer is initialized using a specific sample rate, which is the number of
samples per second

range of human hearing is 20-20k hertz. To be able to hear it, we need to double the source frequency in order to get a sample rate that matches that source frequency 

create a filter to change the audio signal
high pass filter cuts off all noise that exists below a certain frequency

lower pitch means lower frequency
